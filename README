plone4bio.pscoils
=================

Overview
--------

The *plone4bio* package provides the possibility to add a new content
type, called `sequence', than can be either written by hand or imported
from a FASTA file, and to apply to that sequence a program, called
`predictor', that gives a back a plot of predicted probabilites for the
sequence to have a given property (the property that the predictor tries
to determine).

A predictor can try to assess if a protein sequence is trans-membrane,
whether a signal peptide exists, and so on.

The *plone4bio.pscoils* is a package that defines a simple prediction
object based on predictor *biocomp.pscoils*
